2 kilometers of portage, beautiful lakes, calm water, solitude with amazing sunrises and sunsets, do you want to hear more? Come on board Canoe-Camping at La Mauricie National Park, Quebec.

An incredible first adventure mixing our knowledge of camping with our new activity, canoeing. Without a doubt, we made a lot of mistakes that we want to share with you as well as good stories. Getting the best of La Mauricie Canoe Camping. First advice - bring mosquito repellent.

I want to jump in the water! I can't resist anymore! It's raining, and aren't mosquitos supposed to disappear when it's raining?! I am pretty sure that everybody has suffered bad situations during adventures that now are only memories that you can laugh about with your friends. Well, this is one of this stories, especially now while I am writing and watching the videos about it.

A one week trip to Quebec, it was time to use our National Park Discovery Pass. We chose La Mauricie National Park for their backcountry camping and to fulfill that dream in mind of paddling to our campsite with the view of the sunset. Sounds good or no?
The campsite was on Lac Dauphinais, if you see it on the [Parks Canada map](https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/qc/mauricie/visit/cartes-maps "Parks Canada map") there is no road to get there so paddling/portaging was the way to go. It includes the following path:
- 500 meter portage from parking to Lac Soumire
- Paddling Lac Soumire
- 500 meter portage from Lac Soumire to Lac Giron
- Paddling Lac Giron
- 1 km from Lac Giron to Lac Dauphinais
- Paddling from the south side of Lac Dauphinais to our campsite, in this case #2.

Although the portage itself wasn't that bad (no regrets in the moment about getting the lighter canoe!), in our second portage is when the mosquitos started. Almost arriving at Lac Dauphinais we were attacked by a cloud of mosquitos, our only relief was when we arrived at the center of the lake and a breeze moved them away. Now we see why all the other paddlers we saw were covered head to toe.

At our campsite, we found two designated areas separately with a toilet in between. At this point we changed to more layers to protect our skin. Anyway these little guys found a way to bite us between our fingers while we were preparing our dinner. The mosquito situation was at that point very unpleasant. The only way to be safe was inside of the tent, since making a fire wasn't allowed at this particular campsite.

Early morning we decided we had had enough, the sunrise was  beginning and we took that opportunity to pack up camp. Again the mosquito situation wasn't the best so we decided to get off shore and prepare coffee on board. The coffee turned out to be one of the best ever, maybe it got a special taste from all the effort we put in trying not to capsize while preparing it on the canoe. The solitude of being the only ones on the lake was amazing.

With our energy boost ready we continue our trip when it started drizzling. We were happy because rain means no mosquitos. We were so wrong - we got more bites during our paddle and then twice as much during our portages. Legs swollen and red, we arrived at our car and finished this first adventure at La Mauricie.

Things to keep it in mind:
- Make sure you <a href="https://reservation.pc.gc.ca/LaMauricieNationalParkofCanada/LaMauricieBackcountry?Map&gccf=true" title="Parks Canada Reservation System" target="_blank">make a reservation</a> for canoe camping ahead of time. Upon your arrival to the park, stop by the park office for your permit.
- If you see the pictures we didn't cover our legs because we thought insect repellent was enough, but it wasn't. Now I see why everybody was wearing long pants.
- Be careful taking a dip on the coast of the Lac Dauphinais since there are leeches. We only explore the area around campsite #2 so don't know if they are elsewhere as well.
- The trails for portaging are very well marked, easy to follow, and relatively flat.
- The only source of water by our campsite was from lake. We paddled to the center of the lake to get water because it was pretty swampy by the shore.
