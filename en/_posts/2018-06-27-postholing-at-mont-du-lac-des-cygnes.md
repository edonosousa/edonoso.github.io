Running in one of the oldest mountain ranges on earth, adding a new word 'postholing' to our vocabulary and making the best of a foggy day at Mont du Lac des Cygnes.

All throughout the car ride, we couldn't see anything - a thick fog was continually asking us if we want to keep going or return to the city. Having traveled so far we decided to keep postponing the decision...

And then we made it - the Mont du Lac des Cygnes Visitor Center - empty and with the same thick fog and foreboding feeling for what was to come. We had no clue where was the summit, but the snow in the trail was firm making a crunchy sound as we ran. Why should we insist on going to the summit, knowing we won't have a view? And why are the trail markers so close to the ground? We were about to find the answers in the toughest way.

_Forget CrossFit. Forget hot yoga, Soulcycle, Soloflex, and your Body Pump class. There is no better short-duration, full-body workout than postholing._ â€“Maren Horjus, [The case for Postholing](https://www.backpacker.com/skills/winter-skills-snowshoeing), Backpacker Magazine

Trail running or snow running, in this case, was more difficult that we thought. The crunchy sound of the snow changed to a grumbling sound after our feet were swallowed by the snow as we stepped slightly off the tiny path. We plunged hip deep in the snow around 30 times. We had no idea there was a word for this - 'postholing'. (A great description for this word [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-postholing-1766135))

The first question was - how high are we running over the real path? Well, you can find a clue in this picture.

Are we seriously running over 1 meter above the real path, being swallowed by the snow every step and still thinking we are going make it to the summit? ...  The answer was a resounding YES.
We followed a wooden boardwalk near the summit with some flat rocky surfaces as well. We arrived at the top of Mont du Lac des Cygnes, with a nice and incredible... thick fog that allowed us to see nothing.

Not wanting to give up, we waited 30 minutes at the chilly summit, hoping the strong wind would blow the fog away.  In the meantime, one of the information posts on the summit caught our attention. Mont du Lac des Cygnes, part of the Laurentian Mountains, is only 980 meters high and formed 1 billion years ago (For perspective Mount Everest and Mount Blanc are only 200 million years old). After a little more digging we found that the Laurentian Mountains in Canada, are number 10 in the list of [the oldest mountains on earth](https://www.buzzfeed.com/top10s/oldest-mountains-on-earth-ww6q?utm_term=.ic4kJlRrG#.elPgPJBkq). What an amazing experience to be able to walk over one of the oldest mountains in the world. Unfortunately, we weren't able to enjoy the view of the Laurentian range from here but maybe in the summer time, we can try again.

After little change in cloud cover at the summit, we decided it was time to go back down the mountain. We half ran, half potholed down the trail. When we arrived at the parking area, suddenly to our surprise, a clear, sunny and warm day took over the fog and the cold. In front of us, we could see old Mont du Lac des Cygnes. We knew this would happen, and we enjoyed it.
