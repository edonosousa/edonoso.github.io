      <h2>Hola, I'm Eduardo.</h2>
      <p>I care about living my life with two themes in mind: sustainability and the outdoors.</p>
      <p>My love for the outdoors was born years ago during my work in the Chilean Coast Guard, sailing and patrolling the pristine Patagonian fjords.</p>
      <p>In 2015 I traded untouched nature for big city life, when I moved from Chile to the US. As a Market Manager in GrowNYC, I connected communities with their local farmers markets. I learned the ins-and-outs of maintaining a lifestyle that is less impactful to our environment.</p>
      <p>My writing is an intersection of these two passions - engaging curious explorers with my adventures in the mountains, sea and beyond, while promoting sustainable travel and living.</p>
      <p>I have lived and worked in the US and Chile and have travelled to 15 countries across Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas.</p>
